# YourForecast
Project Overview:
“Your Forecast” is a weather website where users can view weather around the world. Users can search their location as well as others. This website will also show weather news including major weather happenings. This website would also provide alerts to users about upcoming bad weather. This project is also able to show years previous weather and future predictive weather up to year in advance. This project will help users better plan their days activities as well as attire. This project will also help protect those who could be in high impact areas such as along the coast where hurricanes are likely to occur.


Your Forecast would include a large audience because of its practical application. It could prove useful to solve a wide variety of problems such as:

• “What do the kids need to wear to the bus stop today?”

• “Should we have soccer practice this Saturday?

• “Should I pack a jacket to go up north?”

• “Will hurricane season impact my Caribbean beach vacation in September?”

With a wide variety of problems, we also have a unique yet large variety of personas. User personas could include parents or young adults who play sports or coach outside sports teams. Personas could also include businessmen who travel long distance. As well as the day to day student who must endure the weather while walking to class. Users also contain those who are planning on traveling in the future but will only decide based on the weather (such as those visiting a beach). This project could prove to be useful to a wide audience. Including those who do not travel often but would like to know what to expect in the upcoming week.

This project anticipates users be able to easily navigate the website on mac or PC. This project is anticipated to have a simple design without bogging down the audience with ads or popups. This helps to quickly provide information users are looking for, whether it’s for their current location or a completely new location. A search bar will be located at the top center of the site where users can place any location they would like, the site would then populate the weather information for the day, as well as a 7 day forecast. Under the 7-day forecast would be more specific details about air quality, chance of rain, and any upcoming important weather events (i.e. storms, hurricanes, snow). Users will also be able to sign up for alerts by location should they wish to keep an eye on a specific location. Alerts will be located at the top of the home page for that user.
